# uselessbox

A very useless box

## Why

No reason, otherwise it wouldn't be useless.

Actually that is not true. You wouldn't be here if it was actually usesless. It wouldn't have been built either. There are a number of uses to it:

* Puzzle - The box has a puzzle mode, in which only a specific order of switching is allowed.
* Checkbox - The main reason it was built. During my work, I needed a reminder to check if I'm on the right course every once in a while. More on this later.
* Fun - The mode where it just acts as a classic, albeit more extensive, with 5 switches and LED's.

Finally the experience of building it was one of the main drivers for the project. Mainly dusting of my knowledge in embedded programming and electronics, as well as gaining some experience with woodworking.

## Result

I've built all of this on prototype board, which I plugged on top of the Arduino like a shield.
